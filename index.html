              I chose this website because it is one I worked on—through Wix—for
              a Careers in the Common Good Winternship. Given Wix’s limits, I
              would like to envision a redesign for the site that I find more
              intuitive and appealing. Furthermore, it is the site for a startup
              with a good mission, which matters to me.

            In the desktop and tablet wireframes, the site maintains a
            content-based conceptual model and the linearity of navigation. With
            that being said, the site is more modular and contains some more
            dynamic and interactive divs so that the site sticks in users minds.
            This wireframe is not colored, so there is still room for contrast
            errors depending on the color scheme. In a more high-fidelity
            wireframe, we can take this into consideration. In the mobile
            wireframe, the site maintains a content-based conceptual model and
            is very linear since phones are taller than they are wide. At the
            bottom, there is a button that opens up an overlay which contains
            some additional information that would likely bore users if it was
            the first thing they saw.

          <a href="https://alejack312.github.io/responsive-redesign/">
            Deployed Site
          </a>

          <p class="inner-text">
            When designing this website, I sought to make it more modular and 
            responsive to resizing. I achieved this using a combination of 
            relative units, flexbox, and CSS grid, which all help to create a 
            layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The new homepage 
            consists of three components: the sidebar, the promotional video, 
            and a dynamic navigation carousel.

            Upon opening the site, the sidebar is collapsed. Pressing the menu 
            button should expand the menu to display the 'About' section and the
            'Become a Member!' section. The 'About' section has an image and 
            another carousel that displays information about the startup.

            Shrinking the screen down to the size of a phone changes the layout.
            The promotional video is located at the top, then the navigation 
            carousel, and lastly, the 'Become a Member!' section. The expandable
            menu is now located at the foot of the page, and toggling the expand 
            arrow opens up the 'About' section with its image and the carousel.

            While this code is responsive, it might not be fully optimized for 
            all screen sizes. Given it being my first forray into responsive 
            redesign with just HTML and CSS, there are things about the site 
            that I would like to fix, like the white border around the body of 
            the page.

            Given more time, I would really polish the site to make it 
            attractive and I would change the homepage—on the desktop/laptop and 
            iPad versions—to have the sidebar expanded upon initial load.
